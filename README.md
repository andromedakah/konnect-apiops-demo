This is a GitHub Actions workflow file is a template workflow that will be triggered on: push, meaning it runs every time code is pushed to the repository. It will configure and deploy reqres service api.

The workflow sets up several environment variables, including KONG_KONNECT_TOKEN, KONG_CP_NAME, SERVICE_NAME, and TAG_NAME. These are used throughout the workflow.

The workflow consists of a single job, deploy-my-demo-api, which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. This job has several steps:

###Setup deck: 
This step uses the kong/setup-deck@v1 action to set up Deck, a command-line tool for Kong Gateway. The version of Deck being used is specified as 1.29.2.

###Clone repo: 
This step uses the actions/checkout@v2 action to clone the repository into the runner, allowing the workflow to access its contents.

###Convert openapi to kong format: 
This step creates a directory named generated and then uses Deck to convert an OpenAPI specification file to a Kong format file. It also adds tags to the services in the generated file.

###add global plugins and routes plugins to the generated file: 
This step uses Deck to add global plugins and route plugins to the generated file.

###deck validate generated file: 
This step uses Deck to validate the generated file, ensuring it is correctly formatted and contains no errors.

###deck diff generated file: 
This step uses Deck to compare the generated file with the current configuration on the Kong control plane. It uses the diff command to show any differences.

###deck sync generated file: 
This step uses Deck to synchronize the generated file with the Kong control plane, applying any changes found in the diff step.

The commented-out section of code appears to be a previous version of the workflow that included a step to backup the old service configuration. This step is not currently being used.

Overall, this workflow automates the process of converting an OpenAPI specification to a Kong format, adding plugins, validating the file, and synchronizing it with the Kong control plane.
